                    <p>I am both a designer and developer in Web. I enjoy bringing a website to life with the small and big changes in code to make a user feel more comfortable. For instance when you click a button, it looks like it is being pressed, or the animation of a rotating slideshow like my projects below. When the sky is not the limit in the computer world I hope to create limitless ideas. Both in web and eventually in software.</p>
